       <h1 class="design">Mobile Shoe Widget User Test</h1>
       <h2 class="company1">Carhartt</h2>
       <h2 class="introShare">Introduction</h2>
       <span class="lineIntro"></span>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Overview</h3>

       <p>In this project, I was tasked with prototyping numerous wireframes depicting the various types of shoes that Carhartt sells. These prototypes were then developed into a usability test with about 15 participants using the platform UserZoom. All these wireframes were designed with a mobile-first approach.</p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Problems</h3>
       <p>
          <ul>
            <li class="introPoint">Designers on the UX team wanted to know which prototyped wireframe worked the best for different users on their mobile devices.</li>
            
            </ul>
       </p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Users and Audience</h3>
       <p>Those looking to buy shoes online using their mobile device, specifically the brand Carhartt.</p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
       <p>I was given 5 different wireframes in Figma, which I then prototyped to have a side-scrolling navigation. I then used these prototypes in a 15-participant usability test meant to determine which design works best for our users. In this test I asked targeted, unbiased questions to conclude which design worked best.</p>
 
       <h2 class="introShare">Process</h2>
       <span class="lineIntro"></span>
 
       <h1 class="number1">01</h1>
         <p>After being given the wireframes in a Figma document, I consulted with a UX Designer on the team to understand what the prototypes should look like and how he wanted the users to navigate the wireframes.</p>
         

         <h1 class="number1">02</h1>
         <p>Then, I utilized Figma’s prototyping tool to add a side-scrolling feature so that when the user is navigating through the different types of shoes listed, they can do so with ease. This allows for the images to be bigger as well, which is often helpful for users who would like a better idea of what they are clicking on before they click it.</p>
         <h3 class="oldImageDesc">All prototyped wireframes side-by-side</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="prototypes.png">
         <p>Here is a screenshot from the Figma file I was working in depicting the different wireframes I prototyped. The two on the right-hand side I prototyped to have a side-scrolling feature, so users would be able to interact with it live when taking the user test.</p>
         
         <h1 class="number1">03</h1>
       <p>Once the prototypes were done, I created a test in UserZoom targeting 15 participants who shop online for shoes a fair amount out of the year and have purchased a Carhartt product previously. With the test, the goal was to determine which prototype/design our users enjoyed using the most and what made the most sense to them from a consumer standpoint.</p>
       <h3 class="oldImageDesc">Test overview displayed to users at the beginning of the test</h3>
       <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="overview1.png">
       
       <h3 class="oldImageDesc">Still prototype task descriptions</h3>
       <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="overview2.png">
       <p>Had outdated information, quick links, pages, and documents that were no longer needed. Lots of empty space taking up valuable room on the page.</p>
       
       <h3 class="oldImageDesc">Interactive prototype task descriptions</h3>
       <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="overview3.png">
       <p>For both task descriptions, I wanted to keep the same format for each. But I made sure to bold the differences in each desciption so that users knew exactly what the difference was. In the different tests I have completed on UserZoom, I have realized how explicit you need to be with your instructions as not everyone will know exactly what to do for each step or understand your implications. I found having a scenario/task format to work well as it gives the user an exact idea of what they need to accomplish in the test and how they might do that.</p>
       
       <h3 class="oldImageDesc">Questions about the prototypes</h3>
       <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="shoeQuestions.png">
       <p>This question allows users to pick their overall favorite design, and the following question asks them to explain the reasoning behind the choice that they made. Having this set-up for this question allows the user to see all of the designs side-by-side, which can also help them to come to a decision.</p>
       <p>Some other questions include:</p>
       <ul>
           <li class="introPoint">What differences did you notice between the experiences?</li>
           <li class="introPoint">How does scrolling to see the other images affect your overall experience?</li>
           <li class="introPoint">Does a larger image make your decision easier/harder?</li>
       </ul>
       <h3 class="oldImageDesc">Results</h3>
       <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="shoeResults1.png">
       <p>Majority of users (47%) liked concept A the best, which was the largest version of the shoes laid out in a list format with tabs at the top. Concept D came in second place at 29%, which was the largest side-scrolling prototype.</p>
       <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="shoeResults2.png">
       <p>Some explanations of the reasons why our participants chose the prototype they did in the end. These answers are pivotal in the entire testing process, as they explain why each user made the choice they did in the end and how they came to that conclusion. As helpful as percentages are with quantifying your results, they don't tell the entire story and that is where these results come in. That is why if I ever form a question such as this one where the user has to choose from a few options or on a rating scale, I always follow up with "please explain your rating/answer".</p>
       
      <h2 class="introShare">Outcomes</h2>
      <span class="lineIntro"></span>
<p>
   <ul>
   <li class="introPoint">We received quality results and explanations as to which prototype is preferred and why. This information was then relayed to the designers, which will then use this information to ensure the most-current designs are of value to different users.</li>
   <li class="introPoint">Having those explanations of each participant really put into perspective why a design was preferred over the others. This helps to really conceptualize the data rather than solely looking at a percentage.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

      <h2 class="introShare">Takeaways</h2>
      <span class="lineIntro"></span>
      <p>
         <ul>
         <li class="introPoint">This project helped to put into perspective why some users prefer some designs over others, and how to accomplish finding out that information through asking the right questions.</li>
         <li class="introPoint">I really enhanced my prototyping skills in Figma as I had to learn a lot about frames and how they are affected by the layering order within a document. At times I had a hard time implementing the side scrolling feature, as I couldn’t always tell which frame was selected. But, I was able to work around this by ensuring I am organizing my layers properly throughout the process.</li>
         </ul>
