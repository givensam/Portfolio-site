       <h2 class="company1">MSU Enviroweather</h2>
       <h2 class="introShare">Introduction</h2>
       <span class="lineIntro"></span>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Overview</h3>

       <p>MSU Enviroweather is an organization focusing on providing crop growers around Michigan with accurate weather data and pest risk prediction models. For this project, I focused on improving the mobile version of MSU Enviroweather’s website and the pest and crop weather models more specifically. The main tool I used for this project was Figma, to create hi-fi mockups which I then prototyped.</p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Problems</h3>
       <p>
          <ul>
            <li class="introPoint">Users of the site have mentioned that the mobile version of the website is hard to navigate and can be frustrating at times to use.</li>
            <li class="introPoint">There are lots of areas where space is being taken up by large images or unnecessary text, rather than displaying the model itself right away.</li>
            <li class="introPoint">Experienced users of the site don’t have the option to minimize directions on how to use the model.</li>
            </ul>
       </p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Users and Audience</h3>
       <p>Growers and farmers around the state of Michigan looking to predict the risk of pest development in their crops on a mobile device.</p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
       <p>My role for this project was to develop hi-fi mockups and prototypes that display solutions for the issues growers are having when using the site, and to improve overall satisfaction of the mobile experience.</p>
 
       <h2 class="introShare">Process</h2>
       <span class="lineIntro"></span>
 
       <h1 class="number1">01</h1>
         <p>In a weekly team meeting I am a part of with Enviroweather as a UX Assistant, it was brought to my attention that the mobile version of Enviroweather’s website needed to be reconfigured due to users not being happy with the usability of the site. </p>
         


         <h1 class="number1">02</h1>
         <p>After hearing of this issue, I analyzed the site on a mobile device to understand and take note of what may be causing this frustration among users. I developed a list of items that were points of difficulty, to help narrow down what to focus on when it came time to start developing mockups.</p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Laid out images of the site before</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/0046a82c-d300-4f3e-b226-0f7b38c0a850">
         <p>This helped to visualize how the site is presenting currently on mobile devices and to display a general overview of what issues are occurring. </p>
         
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Listed out issues that were visible</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/6d0b5f67-dc26-467b-a780-89235af44feb">
         <h1 class="number1">03</h1>
        <p>I started with some rough sketches of how to tackle these issues at hand. This was a good start at visualizing the changes that we could implement to make the mobile experience better.</p>
       
         <h1 class="number1">04</h1>
         <p>I put these sketches into Figma, creating numerous hi-fi wireframes with a couple different options. After creating these, I shared them with my project manager and the front-end developers to get their thoughts and opinions.</p>

         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Wrote down a list of possible solutions</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/db40c59a-3e85-4b52-95f2-6b30542d482d">
         <p>Writing these down allowed me to have a place to reference back to when I didn't know what to focus on next when creating the mockups. This focused my designing to be solution-based so I didn't get off track.
         </p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Model set-up page mockups</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/870df2ce-9768-447b-a315-e9bb58a08889">
        <p>In meetings with our project manager, much of the conversation surrounding the current mobile views for the crop model pages was to try to minimize as much redundant text as possible and to save space, so that the model is really at the forefront. Here, I wanted the model control box to be the one of the first things that users see when they click onto the page. That is why in the mockup on the right you can see how much space was saved.</p>

<h3 class="surveyDesc">Drop-down idea for running models</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/a063e2b7-3205-40ff-a763-7eb4df981b11">
         <p>In this set of mockups, I created the idea of having a drop-down for users to choose which type of data they would like to view. Before, there was a lot of side-scrolling and a very small window to view the data itself. This way the data is presented in a more targeted way and the user can choose specifically what they would like to view. This set of mockups was also prototyped in Figma.</p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Card-like idea for comparing multiple sets of data</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/a45688b6-7743-498f-95f9-daefddb7977a">
         <p>Here, I was playing around with the idea of having a "card-like" design, where users can select multiple data sets at once to compare to one another. One of the developers brought this idea to me with the screenshot on the left, and I turned it into a working mockup with a prototype.</p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Desktop page before with to-do list</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/12051e35-df00-4ca4-b8d9-5b277193ddd2">
         <p>We also wanted to look at how the page was presenting in a desktop view. Here you can see the set up I had to look at the current page and a list of to-do's on the right-hand side.</p>
         
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Desktop mockup idea 1</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/7cde78ce-529e-4f21-9552-0948698cb5bb">
        <p>This was my first idea for the desktop view, going in with the same idea of saving as much space as possible for the model itself. Here, I decided to have a smaller area for selecting a station, date, and biofix. The station would be linked, so that the user could select it to change to another one. I made this choice to easily present the selected station to the user and to save space.</p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Desktop mockup idea 2</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/be82518f-7e98-4188-9039-b4fc5a8a69b1">
        <p>In my second design, I decided to have a small drop-down for input information where the user would make a choice of whether or not they want to view it. This saved a lot more space in the long run and was a bit more well-recieved than my first mockup. I wanted to go for a design similar to that of how you would choose a flight location on a flight booking website.</p>

         <h1 class="number1">05</h1>
 
         <p>After receiving positive feedback about the mockups, I started prototyping them in the same Figma file to develop a visual of how the site’s navigation can work with these changes implemented. This helped my manager and everyone on the team to see the product in action.</p>
         

      <h2 class="introShare">Outcomes</h2>
      <span class="lineIntro"></span>
<p>
   <ul>
   <li class="introPoint">I received positive feedback from my project manager and the front-end developers on the designs, and they felt they would positively help the growers with using the models.</li>
   <li class="introPoint">This project has made my prototyping skills a lot better, as practice makes perfect. I can now use Figma to prototype my designs quite easily.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

      <h2 class="introShare">Takeaways</h2>
      <span class="lineIntro"></span>
      <p>
         <ul>
         <li class="introPoint">Looking back, I wish I would have conducted more research with the users directly. This would have given me a better understanding of where to take the designs. Next time, I would like to run a survey or interviews to find out their thoughts and opinions first-hand.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
