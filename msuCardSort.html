       <h1 class="design">MSU Main Website Card Sort</h1>
       <h2 class="company1">Information Architecture - XA 375</h2>
       <h2 class="introShare">Introduction</h2>
       <span class="lineIntro"></span>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Overview</h3>

       <p>In my Information Architecture course (XA 375), 3 classmates and I were tasked with developing a card sort and site map of a website of our choosing. We decided to go with msu.edu, Michigan State’s main website. For this card sort, we conducted it on FigJam, Figma’s collaborative platform. This was a very useful tool to collaborate with other classmates and have them take our card sorts in class. In total, we had three other groups participate in our sort.</p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Problems</h3>
       <p>
          <ul>
            <li class="introPoint">MSU’s main website has a very complicated site structure. There are many outdated pages still in the site map, many of them link erratically to another, and there is a lot of content to digest.</li>
            <li class="introPoint">The navigation on the site does not match that of the listed out site map.</li>
            </ul>
       </p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Users and Audience</h3>
       <p>As for the website, it is used by MSU students, faculty, and community members looking for more information about the school. Our card sort targeted current Michigan State students.
    </p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
       <p>My role in this project was to put the card sort together in our FigJam file and facilitate the card sort live on Zoom.</p>
 
       <h2 class="introShare">Process</h2>
       <span class="lineIntro"></span>
 
       <h1 class="number1">01</h1>
         <p>I met with my group, and we brainstormed different websites to possibly audit and focus our card sort on. We eventually decided to analyze the main MSU website, as it has many users daily and there is a plethora of content being rotated on the site. Together we looked at the navigation and the original site map, to get a good idea of the different titles and categories available to be sorted.</p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Navigation overview</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/855d8469-01bb-4112-9606-292ecb441eaf">

         <h1 class="number1">02</h1>
         <p>Next, one of my group members curated a list of all the titles on the site found in the top and side navigation bars. I then took this list and uploaded them into FigJam, creating cards for each of the titles available. In total we had 67 cards, which we found later on to be a very large card sort. </p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Cards</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/6761b006-821c-4049-bb0f-e246b790403a">
        <p>To create all these cards, I utilized a FigJam plugin that allowed me to copy all the titles into a long list and it created the boxes for me. This saved a ton of time in the long run.</p>
         <h1 class="number1">03</h1>
        <p>Using a template from FigJam, I put all the cards into an organized box. Underneath that box is a place for our participants to place the cards. I also wrote a set of instructions on the side, for our users to get a good idea of how to complete the sort. This was an open card sort, so it was up to our participants to name each of the groups as they saw fit.</p>
        <h3 class="surveyDesc">Groups</h3>
        <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/0f8953a7-ecb5-496a-b6cf-e93abe841f65">
        <p>We decided to go with an open card sort to give our particpants more creative freedom when it came time to sort the cards into categories. We wanted to see how they would interpret the cards and if they chose different categories to that of the website.</p>
        <h3 class="surveyDesc">Card Sort</h3>
        <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/4ca0fb4a-9dc5-4322-8206-8fd49e36d652">
         <p>Here is our final card sort. The sorting area was placed underneath the cards, which initally seemed like a good choice but if I were to go back I would place it next to the cards. That way our partipants can utilize the most of their screen size and won't have to scroll up and down.</p>
        
        <h1 class="number1">04</h1>
         <p>Once the card sort was created, it came time for us to run and facilitate the study. In class, we were placed into breakout rooms where members of my group would rotate in and out to participate in other card sorts. I stayed back in my room the entire time, as I was the main facilitator for this sort. My job was to ensure that all our participants understood exactly what to do, and to answer any questions they may have had during it.</p>
        <p>During the sort we realized a few mistakes we made when making the card sort:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li class="introPoint">The instructions were not as in depth as they could have been.</li>
                <li class="introPoint">We had a ton of cards, which given the amount of time in class participants had to complete the sort it was a bit too many. Each sort lasted about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li class="introPoint">Leaving the sort to be open was overwhelming for our participants on top of the number of cards.</li>
                <li class="introPoint">Many did not know they could create their own groups beyond the 4 that we gave them initially, so they started to place the cards off to the side instead.</li>
                <li class="introPoint">I tried to remain as engaging as possible without interrupting the sorting session, but the participants were hesitant to ask questions. </li>
                <li class="introPoint">Many who did not already have Figma accounts had to create one in order to join the study and start sorting.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

         <h1 class="number1">05</h1>
         <p>After completing our card sorts, our group presented our findings to the class.</p>

      <h2 class="introShare">Outcomes</h2>
      <span class="lineIntro"></span>
<p>
   <ul>
   <li class="introPoint">We realized many ways to improve our sort throughout this project. But this was a really great way to know what to focus on and improve upon for next time which is always a good thing.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

      <h2 class="introShare">Takeaways</h2>
      <span class="lineIntro"></span>
      <p>
         <ul>
         <li class="introPoint">This was my first time facilitating a live research study, which I was a bit nervous for initially. Once we got it going though, I felt comfortable knowing I could help to make the experience a good one for our participants by being engaging and letting them know I would be willing to help in any way.</li>
         <li class="introPoint">If I create a card sort again using FigJam, it would be beneficial to get the paid version of the software as there are such things as “open sessions”. These are specifically made for activities such as card sorts, where users who might not have edit access to the document need to edit for a period of time. This would help those who do not have a Figma account prior to the test.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
