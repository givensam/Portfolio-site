       <h1 class="design">IT SharePoint Website Redesign</h1>
       <h2 class="company1">Carhartt</h2>
       <h2 class="introShare">Introduction</h2>
       <span class="lineIntro"></span>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Overview</h3>

       <p>Over the course of three months, I produced a redesign of Carhartt’s internal IT SharePoint website. This website is a space for associates within the company to find up to date IT news, resources, files, and user support contact information. To achieve a successful redesign of the site, I used principles related to user research, accessibility, information architecture, and UX design.</p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Problems</h3>
       <p>
          <ul>
            <li class="introPoint">The old site was not up to date, housed pages and files not in use, and promoted documents that were no longer used in the business model from months prior.</li>
            <li class="introPoint">Many associates did not use the site very frequently and some did not know it even existed.</li>
            <li class="introPoint">Level 1 user support team found too many associates were calling for small issues, rather than making their own tickets or resetting their own passwords.</li>
            </ul>
       </p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Users and Audience</h3>
       <p>Carhartt associates and employees looking for IT updates and information, along with a way to troubleshoot issues.</p>
       <h3 class="introTitle">Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
       <p>My job was to develop a solution for the influx of calls to user support and create an up to date site that associates want to frequently use.</p>
 
       <h2 class="introShare">Process</h2>
       <span class="lineIntro"></span>
 
       <h1 class="number1">01</h1>
         <p>First, I analyzed the site at a high-level to get an understanding of where it was at and what the general issues were prior to understanding user behavior. During this phase (and throughout the whole project) I met with the Change, Incident, Support Manager to see what the internal issues were from an administrative perspective.</p>
         
         <h3 class="oldImageDesc">Home page</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/29dcb279-763e-4dff-9516-477da54f6008">
         <p>Had outdated information, quick links, pages, and documents that were no longer needed. Lots of empty space taking up valuable room on the page.</p>
         <h3 class="oldImageDesc">Help page</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/f8f7fb0f-bbdc-429d-afe9-4514a6e4cd0f">
         <p>Contact information is placed in more of a list-format. Room for improvement to place contact info more strategically so that calling user support is not the first resort.</p>
         <h3 class="oldImageDesc">FAQ page</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/80a4a508-9a78-4f0e-b5e1-cd3461cab1e8">
         <p>Very simple list format, with not a ton of context for each question present. User has to click on each to get a good understanding of what the content truly is.</p>


         <h1 class="number1">02</h1>
         <p>Next, I familiarized myself with SharePoint by taking numerous LinkedIn Learning courses and by making a test site where I put my newfound skills to use. Prior to the internship I had no SharePoint experience, and afterwards I can say I am quite proficient in it. I played around with SharePoint as best as I could to get a good understanding of all the web parts that were available and how the site stored information. This eventually played a large part in deciding which elements to include on the site.</p>
      <h1 class="number1">03</h1>
       <p>Developed a survey to better understand user behavior on the site and which areas needed to be improved upon. The goal was to ask unbiased, thoughtful questions to gain quality audience understanding and opinions. This helped to drive user-focused solutions when it came time to move forward with the redesign itself.</p>
       <p>
          <ul>
             <li class="introPoint">Before sending the survey out, I consulted with the customer insights manager to get a better understanding of how to ask questions properly and form them in a way that makes data organization easier.</li>
          </ul>
       </p>
       <h3 class="surveyDesc">Overview</h3>
       <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/7c4e01a7-71e8-444b-a618-edb9e54ded48">
       <p>A brief overview of the purpose of the user survey, who the target audience is, dates the survey was live, types of questions, and number of responses.</p>
       <h3 class="surveyDesc">Content Breakdown</h3>
       <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/assets/152744999/ec32a9b1-9f6f-4b54-904e-841274b7bdfe">
       <p>A breakdown of the content within the survey, organized into three different categories. This includes a screener section to understand more about the users taking the survey, the main desktop and mobile experience section, and an open-ended section for any final thoughts.</p>

         <h1 class="number1">04</h1>
         <p>After receiving the results, I separated the data into qualitative and quantitative and analyzed each.</p>

         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Qualitative Findings</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/issues/16#issue-2024382315">
         <p>For each qualitative finding, I produced a possible solution to the issue that associates were mentioning throughout the survey. This helped to propel the redesign along and create focus areas for the site in the future.</p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">Quantitative Findings</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="https://github.com/givensam/Portfolio-site/issues/17#issue-2024382534">
         <p>The quantitative findings did a great job of displaying numerical values and percentages associated with the findings. This put into perspective which areas I needed to focus on first.</p>

         <h1 class="number1">05</h1>
 
         <p>Using the test SharePoint site I created, I started making test pages of various mockups using the different web parts that SharePoint has to offer. I played around with types of linking, how to display news in various ways, document libraries, SharePoint lists, navigation, etc. I ensured to consider the results from the survey by getting rid of unneeded documents/pages, reducing the learning curve of the site by writing in-depth introductions of each page and its purpose, change navigation to push ServiceNow access and a way to reset passwords easily, and producing a central “information hub” where associates can navigate to and find all information the site has to offer in one library.</p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">New home page</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="/Users/ameliagivens/Desktop/Applying Things/Portfolio/ITHome.png">
         <p>Went for a very minimalistic design, while keeping visual elements throughout. Updated the quick links to have an option to reset your password, along with linking to the “Need IT Help?” page. Moved Carhartt System Status Station (a place to understand if outages are occurring and how long they might take to be resolved) to the home page for ease of access. A new development on the home page is the System Status Indicator, which is the stop light on the right-hand side. This displays a visual representation of outage statuses. I created this in Figma, along with two other variations of yellow and red.</p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">New IT help page</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="/Users/ameliagivens/Desktop/Applying Things/Portfolio/needItHelp.png">
         <p>Wanted to push associates to create their own tickets, rather than calling as their first resort (seen in the placement of options to submit a ticket). Also gave the option to reset your network password. 
         </p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">New How-To's and FAQ's</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="/Users/ameliagivens/Desktop/Applying Things/Portfolio/howToFAQ.png">
         <p>Added a “latest roll-outs” section so it is easy to find the newest/more recent additions and combined FAQ’s and How-To’s as they are fairly similar sections.
            </p>
         <h3 class="surveyDesc">New IT Information Hub</h3>
         <img class="oldHome-image" border="0" align="center" src="/Users/ameliagivens/Desktop/Applying Things/Portfolio/infoHub.png">
            <p>This is a new addition to the site that I came up with to house all documents and information available on the site in one location. There are color-coded categories for each file type, so it's easy to locate what users might be looking for. A description is added for each file, to explain more about what it is prior to clicking on the item. This was inspired from many of the responses on the survey, as many users were explaining how it can be difficult to find certain items on the site.</p>
         <h1 class="number1">06</h1>
         <p>I collaborated with my manager, and we determined a date to make the site live. In this process, I attended a “CAB” meeting (where all tickets are overseen and approved), where I briefly explained my work and defended the reason for the implementation of the site. It went live the next day!</p>

      <h2 class="introShare">Outcomes</h2>
      <span class="lineIntro"></span>
<p>
   <ul>
   <li class="introPoint">Once the site was published, I received positive feedback from the Change, Incident, and Support Manager and from many associates I presented to at the end of my internship.</li>
   <li class="introPoint">Many enjoyed the minimalistic design, and the fact it was up to date and easy to access information.</li>
   <li class="introPoint">The site is live and active and continues to be used by associates every day.</li>
   </ul>
</p>

      <h2 class="introShare">Takeaways</h2>
      <span class="lineIntro"></span>
      <p>
         <ul>
         <li class="introPoint">I learned a ton on this project when it comes to researching your audience, conducting user research, implementing that research to develop a solution, and creating that solution. The full process was very rewarding in this regard.</li>
         <li class="introPoint">I met a lot of people throughout the course of this project, through seeking out advice from teams and people that were in different departments to me.</li>
         <li class="introPoint">SharePoint can be limiting in terms of design and is typically not a UX designer’s tool of choice. But it is a very robust platform that makes it easy for organizations and teams to create collaborative and informative websites which is very important to keeping a company communicative.</li>
         </ul>
      </p>
